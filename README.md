<h1 title="soon â€” the task timer that loves developers">ðŸ”œ â€” the task timer that ðŸ’™s developers</h1>

`soon` is a task timer with opinions on how to optimize your development time for:

* completing meaningful work
* peak performance and recovery
* achieving flow
* mental and physical well being
* hugs & tacos

The only opinion `soon` has about task or to-do lists is that you should use them. Out of the box `soon` supports [GFM task lists][GFM task lists], git feature branches, GitHub pull requests, and GitHub issues. Your favorite task list software is supported via plugins.

On the surface `soon` has similarities to [a popular technique][pomodoro]. Our scope is smaller and our approach different; `soon` is a tool not a methodology.
