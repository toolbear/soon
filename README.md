<h1 title="soon">🔜</h1>

The task timer that 💙s developers and optimizes your time for:

* shipping meaningful work
* peak performance and recovery
* achieving flow
* mental and physical well being
* hugs & tacos

The only opinion soon has about task or to-do lists is that you should use them. Out of the box it finds tasks from [Markdown task lists][GFM task lists], feature branches, pull requests, and GitHub issues. Mac users may be interested in the [Reminders][soon-osx-reminders] plugin. Authoring a plugin for your favorite task list manager is straightforward.

On the surface it has similarities to [a popular technique][pomodoro]. Soon is a tool not a methodology.

## Using Soon for Great Success

Top performers in their vocation (violinists, athletes) have similar practice/training schedules. They focus intensely for 90 minutes followed by 15-20 minutes of rest.

The stages of sleep follow a 90-120 minute cycle and research indicates this [pertinent periodicity][ultradian rhythm] persists when we are awake. Our alertness, ability to focus, and energy level rise and fall in time to this rhythm.

[ultradian rhythm]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultradian_rhythm

Coincidence? Maybe. Science? Possibly. If you are already looking to constrain your development sessions to an arbitrary length, why not a duration with a track record of success and which might not be that arbitrary?

Our experience coding in short sessions — typically 25 minutes — left us feeling like the break arrived abruptly, right as things [started flowing][flow]. Breaks became interruptions. We abandoned the timer. In its absence we coded long past the point of diminishing mental returns; we sat [sedentary for hours][too much sitting]; we forgot to eat. Even the [lazy panda eats][lazy panda eats]!

We were sad pandas.

We want to be happy pandas.

“What about longer sessions?” we thought. We resolved to try longer sessions.

“While we're at it,” we also thought, “what's with these half-implemented task list managers bolted on to our timer? We've plenty of tasks already documented in `TODO`. Plus a handful of issues in GitHub and the occasional contributed pull request. Shall we adopt another task list tool solely for task timing?”

We shan't do that.

Pandas nap. So do top performers (and they sleep 8 hours a night).

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js][node]

2. Install soon globally

  ```console
  $ sudo npm install -g soon
  ```

3. Install [hub][hub] and alias `git` to `hub`

4. Run `. <(soon completion)` to add tab completion to the current shell. To make it permanent:

  [Oh-My-Zsh][oh-my-zsh] users enable the `soon` plugin.

  ```zsh
  plugins=(git osx terminalapp soon)
  ```

  Everyone else add the following to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

  ```console
  . <(soon completion)
  ```

[hub]: https://hub.github.com "the command-line wrapper for git"
[node]: http://nodejs.org
[oh-my-zsh]: http://ohmyz.sh

## Doing Work

### Use git.

Soon relies on `git` to find the root of your current project, determine the current branch, and detect feature branches. It relies on `git` wrapped by [hub][hub] to find pull requests and issues.

### Pick an available task. Begin work.

Available tasks come in many forms.

* an [incomplete task][GFM task lists] in `README` or `TODO`
* the current branch
* local feature branches that are ahead of `master`
* an open pull request or open issue

Work how you always have, soon will find them.

Use `soon ls` to list available tasks for the current project, optionally filtering by type (e.g. `--pull-request` or `--todo`).

```console
$ soon ls
☂ Tiggers != wonderful things
★ Ride balloon to beehive

$ git checkout -b give-eeyore-a-hug
Switched to a new branch 'give-eeyore-a-hug'
$ soon ls
⎇ give-eeyore-a-hug
☂ Tiggers != wonderful things
★ Ride balloon to beehive

$ soon ls --issue
☂ Tiggers != wonderful things
```

Indicate that you've started a task with `soon work TASK`.

```console
$ soon work 'Ride balloon to beehive'
```

The task description must match an available task. Tab completion is your friend.

```console
$ soon work give<TAB>
$ soon work give-eeyore-a-hug

$ soon work 'Ride<TAB>
$ soon work 'Ride balloon to beehive'

$ soon work <TAB>
⎇ give-eeyore-a-hug
☂ Tiggers != wonderful things
★ Ride balloon to beehive
```

The same type filters as with `soon ls` can be used.

```console
$ soon work --issue '<TAB>
$ soon work --issue 'Tiggers != wonderful things'
```

Tab completion is context aware and super smart so you can get on with actual work.

### Develop for 90 minutes. Relax for 15. Repeat.

When you begin work on a task soon starts the timer.

```console
$ soon work 'Ride balloon to beehive'
★ Ride balloon to beehive
90 minutes remaining
```

Tasks are as big or as small as you make them. A single task could span several sessions or you could complete several tasks in a single session.

When you start a task partway through a session soon reports the time remaining.

```console
$ soon work give-eeyore-a-hug
⎇ give-eeyore-a-hug
47 minutes remaining
```

When you resume after a break soon suggests the task you last worked on (unless you completed it). Or you can resume it automatically.

```console
$ soon work <TAB>
Current task
  ⎇ give-eeyore-a-hug
Available tasks
  ⎇ give-eeyore-a-hug
  ☂ Tiggers != wonderful things
  ★ Ride balloon to beehive

$ soon work --continue
You rested for 17 minutes
⎇ give-eeyore-a-hug
90 minutes remaining
```

Sometimes the session is over but you have one small thing remaining.

```console
$ soon work 'Tiggers != wonderful things'
You've been working for 92 minutes
Briefly defer the break (y/N): Y
☂ Tiggers != wonderful things
13 minutes remaining
```

*If you consistently extend your sessions soon will eventually increase the default session duration*

Sometimes that small task wasn't so small after all.

```console
$ soon work --abort
Aborted “☂ Tiggers != wonderful things” after 8 minutes
Take a break
Come back in about 15 minutes
```

### Eat when hungry.

Take your time. There's no late penalty. Soon assumes longer breaks will occur every few sessions even so much as skipping an entire work/rest cycle.

*If you consistently take longer breaks soon will eventually increase the default break duration*

### Take a nap when sleepy.

No, really.

Routine siesta taking [lowers your coronary mortality by 37%][siesta for health]; even occasional siesta has benefits. Short naps 10-20 minutes in duration reinvigorate while avoiding waking up with a case of the groggies. REM sleep is associated with mastering complex skills. You go through every stage of sleep, including REM, within 90-110 minutes.

[siesta for health]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17296887

Unsurprisingly you can substitute lunch+siesta or a long nap for a work/rest cycle.

### Ship it! Mark it complete.

Ship the thing. Mark it complete in your task management tool. Tell soon you're done.

```console
$ soon work --complete
Fixed “☂ Tiggers != wonderful things” in 2½ hours (3¼ hours wall-clock)
75 minutes until your next break

$ soon work <TAB>
…
```

When you know you have plenty of remaining time, skip `work --complete` and just begin a new task.

```console
$ soon work Ride<TAB>
$ soon work Ride\ balloon\ to\ beehive
Fixed “☂ Tiggers != wonderful things” in 2½ hours (3¼ hours wall-clock)
★ Ride balloon to beehive
75 minutes remaining
```

### Do it again or stop for now.

That.

## Notifications

Most of the time you're not interacting with soon. When it's absolutely necessary to get your attention, soon will use a notification. Attached to a terminal, `soon` will print a notification message along with a `<bell>` character. On OS X, it will also use *Notification Center* unless  you specify `--no-notification-center`.

For notifications to be effective soon must either be actively running or it must be run at least every couple of minutes. Some options:

1. **Interactive Mode** — run `soon --interactive` in a new terminal.

  ```console
  $ soon --interactive

  # … time passes

  <bell>
  Time for a break
  Come back in about 15 minutes
  ```

  See [Interactive Mode](#interactive-mode) for what else you can do.

2. **launchd on OS X** — the soon `launchd` agent issues *Notification Center* notifications. Install it once.

  ```console
  $ soon launchd >~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.npmjs.package.soon.plist
  $ launchctl -w com.npmjs.package.soon
  ```
5. **tmux** — tmux status bar with a doodad representing the current task type and the timer. Green when you're working, red when on break, no doodad and default foreground when you haven't told soon what you're working on.

3. **Grunt (experimental)** — If you use [Grunt][gruntjs] you can try the [grunt plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-soon).

4. **zsh prompt (experimental)** — [Oh-My-Zsh][oh-my-zsh] users using the `soon` plugin can add a timer to their prompt. You will only get timely notifications with frequent command-line use.

[gruntjs]: http://gruntjs.com

## Interactive Mode

* status bar showing current task and work/break timer
* automatic notifications
* command prompt with tab completion

```console
$ soon --interactive
>  ls
☂ Tiggers != wonderful things
★ Ride balloon to beehive

> ls --pull-request
★ Ride balloon to beehive

> work give<TAB>
> work give-eeyore-a-hug
⎇ give-eeyore-a-hug
47 minutes remaining
```
